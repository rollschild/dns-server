# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context

Whenever working with this codebase (or any codebase), ALWAYS ask me first about any changes or modifications you are trying to make, and do NOT make those changes without me explicitly allowing so.

ALWAYS show me the code/implemention without me having to type `/plan` myself.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Enter Nix development environment
nix develop

# Build with CMake
cmake . -B build
cmake --build build

# Run
./build/src/main

# Enable and run tests (GTest)
cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build

# Run a single test
ctest --test-dir build -R <test_name>
```

## Development Environment

- **Language**: C++23 (required standard)
- **Build System**: CMake 3.29+
- **Package Manager**: Nix Flakes
- **Test Framework**: Google Test (GTest), Catch2 v3 available
- **Code Style**: Google style, 4-space indent (see `.clang-format`)

## Compiler Configuration

- Compiler: GCC
- Flags: `-Wall -Wfatal-errors -Wextra -Werror -g -O1`

## Architecture

DNS server using UDP sockets on port 2053. Entry point is `src/main.cpp` which sets up a UDP socket, binds to the port, and runs an event loop receiving DNS queries and sending responses.
